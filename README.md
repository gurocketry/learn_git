# Learning Git 

## Motivation

**Why learn git?**

Git is the industry-standard when it comes to sharing codebases. \
It is crucial for any software engineer and an incredibly useful skill to have if you ever have to code in a team.

**Why are we using git?**

- We can share code changes quickly.
- We can keep history of previus code in case something breaks (version control).
- Enables multiple people to work simultaneously, without breaking everything (branching & merging).
- Allows us to see reasons for changes made to the code (commit messages).

## Objectives

- People can set up git on their local machine.
- People can clone repositories.
- People can make changes to the online repository.
- People can understand the basics of dealing with merge conflicts.
- People can make branches and merge branches into primary branch.
